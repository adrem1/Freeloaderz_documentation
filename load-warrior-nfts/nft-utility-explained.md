# ðŸ¥½ NFT Utility Explained

## SmartClaimz discount utility&#x20;

#### Holders of LoadWarrior NFTs can access SmartClaimz and claim at a discounted rate.&#x20;

For Series 1 (total supply 250 NFTs) the available discount rates are as follows:

* 25 NFTs @50% Discount (10% of supply)
* 75 NFTs @25% Discount (30% of supply)
* 150 NFTs @10% Discount (60% of supply)

For Series 2 (total supply 1250 NFTs) the available discount rates are as follows:

* 125 NFTs @50% Discount (10% of supply)
* 375 NFTs @25% Discount (30% of supply)
* 750 NFTs @10% Discount (60% of supply)

Simply connect your NFT-containing wallet to [https://smartclaimz.io/](https://smartclaimz.io/) and claim at discounted rates. Please remember that tokens on SmartClaimz accumulate, so you can claim less frequently and save transaction fees.

## Staking utility

#### Freeloaderz has partnered with CardanoLands to offer our NFT holders a second utility layer: LoadWarriors can be staked on CardanoLands to generate a recurring cashflow.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that this utility is currently only available to Series 2 holders. We are working on extending this utility back to Series 1 as well.
{% endhint %}

CardanoLands is the first NFT Staking DeFi Hub on Cardano: the platform provides an intuitive and fun way to provide liquidity and earn rewards.

{% hint style="info" %}
NFTs will never leave the usersâ€™ wallet and can still be traded.
{% endhint %}

Holders of LoadWarriors can stake them on [https://cardanolands.com/](https://cardanolands.com/) by simply connecting their wallet containing the NFTs. Holders are rewarded with $HEXO, an in-game currency for CardanoLands and can claim their rewards cumulatively, as long as they log on with their wallet once a month.

$HEXO can be used to play a crafting game, which gives a chance for $ADA and other rewards through a raffle system.&#x20;

Users of CardanoLands can also choose to vote for Freeloaderz LoadWarriors as their favourite project using $EXO, a second token native to CardanoLands used for governance.

{% hint style="success" %}
Example, based on HEXO-ADA pair exchange rate and Mining Power of NFTs at the time of writing:

**10 NFTs (25 ADA ea) = 27.4 HEXO per day = 0.011 ADA per day** (Updated 23.03.2023)

This approximately equates to 4 ADA per year on a 250 ADA investment (approx 1.6% APY)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that these figures will change based on HEXO market value and NFT mining power.
{% endhint %}

Also note that the figures above are assuming the NFT holder does little to participate in game other than claiming HEXO and trade HEXO for ADA on a DEX.&#x20;

#### Holders who actually play the game could see their rewards go higher.
