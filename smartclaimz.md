## What is Smartclaimz?

The current cost of processing transactions for airdrop and token distribution is high and often takes a long time. This can result in a frustrating and distressing user experience. Often times, it isn't clear if the transaction was even submitted correctly. SmartClaimz addresses these user experience issues with a faster/clearer transaction with less fees overall. This is achieved by:

* Freeloaderz SPOs providing the Cardano Submit API end point on their pool Relays
* A load balancer providing a round robin distribution to these Relays for transactions
* Native script processing to allow for parallel transactions
* The ability to accumulate your rewards instead of having to claim every epoch (less network transactions overall)
* Web3 dApp wallet connection
* Optimized UTXO management

## How does SmartClaimz work?

SmartClaimz is powered by Drasil-Core, specifically the "Reward & Distribution Application" created and run by [Drasil](https://www.drasil.io/). It is just one of a suite of applications designed to power-up developers, making it quick and easy to develop secure dApps on Cardano.&#x20;

The Reward & Distribution Application integrates neatly with the SmartClaimz web app, enabling one-click instant claims, claim history, automated reward calculations and distribution, and staking delegation.

The SmartClaimz website is an open source Angular project available on the [Freeloaderz Github](https://github.com/FreeLoaderz/rwd-frontend). If you have any concerns regarding how your wallet is used, you can view the code and see exactly how we are using it.
